# Personal-Virtual-Wardrobe

The Clothing App is an Android application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, designed to help users organize and explore their wardrobe. It categorizes outfits into Traditional and Western dress collections, displaying them in a visually appealing and scrollable card layout.

Users can add new dresses by capturing images through the camera or selecting them from the gallery. The app uses state management and mutable lists to dynamically update the UI as new dresses are added. It also implements navigation components to switch between different screens smoothly (e.g., Home, Traditional, Western).

This project showcases effective use of Composable functions, alert dialogs, image handling, and Activity Result APIs, offering a clean and modern Android UI experience.
